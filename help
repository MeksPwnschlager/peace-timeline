Schritte:

import SVG as code
2 layers of SVG with parallax
front effects with Particle system
Waypoints for effects



What I need to do:

* load SVGs with layers for parallax
* On one layer: Effects layer (for example Fog) --> modify svg
* Front Layer with fx like rain, snow etc
* Trigger different FX and animations on waypoint
